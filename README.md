# PARA-Programming Agent Skills

Cross-client Agent Skills package for the PARA-Programming methodology.

**Research -> Plan -> Review -> Execute -> Review -> Summarize -> Archive**

## What Is This?

PARA-Programming is a structured workflow for AI-assisted development. It keeps plans, research, execution state, reviews, summaries, and archives in a project-local `context/` directory so long-running work can survive context resets and client changes.

This repository packages the methodology as open-standard Agent Skills. The skill layout follows the emerging portable `SKILL.md` convention promoted by agentskills.io: each skill lives in its own directory, the directory basename matches frontmatter `name`, and assets/references stay beside the skill that owns them.

## Supported Clients

| Client | Status | Install path |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| OpenAI Codex | Supported out of the box | `scripts/install.sh` installs to `~/.agents/skills` and mirrors to `~/.codex/skills` |
| Gemini CLI | Supported out of the box | Uses the same `~/.agents/skills` install written by `scripts/install.sh` |
| Pi | Supported out of the box | Uses the same `~/.agents/skills` install written by `scripts/install.sh` |
| OpenCode | Supported out of the box | Uses the same `~/.agents/skills` install written by `scripts/install.sh` |
| Cursor | Supported out of the box | Uses the same `~/.agents/skills` install written by `scripts/install.sh` |
| Claude Code | Use the Claude plugin | Use `github.com/brian-lai/para-programming-plugin` |

For Claude Code, use the original PARA-Programming plugin: `https://github.com/brian-lai/para-programming-plugin`. This repository is the open-standard/Codex-oriented Agent Skills package.

### Invocation

The canonical request form is `para-<skill> [arguments]`. Client selectors are presentation syntax; if the client is unknown, name the skill and intent in natural language.

<!-- para-client-invocation-map:start -->
| Client | User-facing form |
|---|---|
| OpenAI Codex | `$para-<skill> [arguments]` |
| Cursor | `/para-<skill> [arguments]` |
| Pi, skill commands enabled | `/skill:para-<skill> [arguments]` |
| Pi, skill commands disabled | `natural-language` — `Use the para-<skill> skill <intent-and-arguments>.` |
| OpenCode | `natural-language` — `Use the para-<skill> skill <intent-and-arguments>.` |
| Gemini CLI | `natural-language` — `Use the para-<skill> skill <intent-and-arguments>.` |
| Unknown client | `natural-language` — `Use the para-<skill> skill <intent-and-arguments>.` |
<!-- para-client-invocation-map:end -->

### Management and discovery

Management commands list, reload, enable, or inspect skills; they are not portable workflow invocations. Use the client-specific skill manager or debug interface to verify discovery.

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `para-init` | Initialize PARA structure in a project |
| `para-research <task>` | Deep codebase research before planning |
| `para-plan <task>` | Create a planning document with self-review |
| `para-review --plan\|--pr` | Review a plan or PR with Staff+ criteria |
| `para-execute` | Create a worktree and execute one checklist item per commit |
| `para-workflow` | Orchestrate execute, review, summarize, and merge across phases |
| `para-status` | Check current workflow state |
| `para-summarize` | Generate a post-work summary |
| `para-archive` | Archive context and start fresh |
| `para-check` | Decide whether a request needs the PARA workflow |
| `para-help` | Show quick reference |

## Installation

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for client-specific installation paths and support notes.

For Codex local skill installation from a checkout:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
```

The installer follows the current Codex Skills guide by installing user skills into `~/.agents/skills`. It also mirrors into `~/.codex/skills` for older local runtimes.

Preview the install without writes:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh --dry-run
```

## Project Context

The workflow creates project-local context files:

```text
context/
├── context.md
├── plans/
├── summaries/
├── archives/
├── data/
└── servers/
```

`resources/AGENTS.md` contains the global PARA workflow methodology template. `docs/METHODOLOGY.md` explains the rationale and lifecycle in detail.

## Adapted From

These skills were generalized from the original `para-programming-plugin` command set and converted to portable Agent Skills:

- `CLAUDE.md` -> `AGENTS.md`
- `~/.claude/` -> `~/.agents/`
- Client-specific commands -> portable `para-command` skill identifiers
- `commands/*.md` -> `skills/para-*/SKILL.md`
