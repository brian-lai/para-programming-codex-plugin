Generate a summary document from the current work session. Supports both simple and phased plans.

## Usage

```
para-summarize                   # Auto-detect active plan/phase
para-summarize --phase=N         # Summarize specific phase
```

## What It Does

1. Reads `worktree_path` from `context/context.md` JSON metadata
2. Analyzes git changes from the worktree using `git -C {worktree_path} diff main...HEAD` and `git -C {worktree_path} log main..HEAD`
3. Reviews the active plan or phase from `context/context.md`
4. Creates summary in the main working tree: `context/summaries/YYYY-MM-DD-task-name-summary.md` or `...-phase-N-summary.md`
5. Uses `assets/summary-template.md` as the summary structure
6. Updates `context/context.md`: moves plan from active context to completed summaries, updates timestamp, and marks phase status as completed when relevant

## Summary Sections

- **Date & Status** -- when completed, success/failure
- **Changes Made** -- files modified/created with line references from the worktree diff
- **Rationale** -- why these changes were made
- **MCP Tools Used** -- preprocessing tools utilized
- **Key Learnings** -- insights, follow-up tasks, gotchas
- **Test Results** -- pass/fail status and coverage metrics

## Implementation

1. Get current date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
2. Read `context/context.md` to find active plan and `worktree_path`
3. If `worktree_path` is set, analyze changes with:
   - `git -C {worktree_path} diff main...HEAD` for file-level changes
   - `git -C {worktree_path} log main..HEAD --oneline` for commit history
4. If no `worktree_path` exists, fall back to `git diff` and `git status` on the current branch
5. Extract task name from plan filename
6. Create summary file in the main working tree with template from `assets/summary-template.md`
7. Update `context/context.md` metadata
8. Display summary location

## Post-Summarize Guidance

### Standalone Mode

If the `para-summarize` skill was used standalone, not as part of the `para-workflow` skill, the next steps are:

1. Push the branch: `git -C {worktree_path} push -u origin para/{task-name}`
2. Create a PR: `gh pr create` from the worktree branch
3. Use the `para-archive` skill to clean up the worktree and archive context

### Orchestrated Mode

If `para-summarize` was invoked as Step 4 of the `para-workflow` skill, the PR was already created in Step 2 of the workflow. Skip the manual push/PR instructions above and return control to the `para-workflow` skill for merge and archive handling.
