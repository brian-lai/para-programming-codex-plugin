# PARA-Programming Codex Plugin

This document contains project-specific context only.

## CRITICAL (MUST FOLLOW RULES)
**Workflow Methodology:** Follow the global workflow guide at `~/.agents/AGENTS.md`

**Never commit directly to main.** All code changes — including small fixes, version bumps, and one-liners — must go through the full PARA workflow: plan → worktree branch → PR → review → merge. There is no such thing as "too small for a PR."

## About This Project

The PARA-Programming Codex Plugin is the OpenAI Codex adaptation of the PARA-Programming methodology for structured AI-assisted development workflows. It provides 11 skills for research, planning, review, execution, summarization, and archival — following the workflow: Research → Plan → Review → Execute → Review → Summarize → Archive.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Codex plugin system
- **Format:** SKILL.md files with YAML frontmatter
- **Documentation:** Markdown

## Key Files

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`: Plugin manifest with metadata and skill path
- `resources/AGENTS.md`: Global workflow methodology template
- `skills/*/SKILL.md`: Individual skill implementations

## Conventions

- All context files use `YYYY-MM-DD-` date prefixes for chronological sorting
- Skills use the `para-<name>` hyphenated naming pattern
- Markdown is used for all documentation and context files
- AGENTS.md used instead of CLAUDE.md (Codex-native convention)

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install via marketplace entry
# Copy examples/marketplace-entry.json to ~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json
# Restart Codex

# Initialize PARA structure in a project with the para-init skill

# Create a plan with the para-plan skill and a task description

# Check workflow status with the para-status skill
```
